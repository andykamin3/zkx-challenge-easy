# ZKX Encode Club Easy Challenge Submission
ZKX Building DAO Proposal (easy)
## Objective
Write a proposal DAO voting features that balance power of active users and power of whales (massive token holders), with governance proposals.
## Proposal
We propose for DAOs to adopt a bicameral configuration for their governance. Doing this would prove useful as they could have one chamber where voting power is determined by the token amounts each member holds while the other one more closely relays contributors‚Äô views and opinions. Moreover, not every subject should have to be decided by both chambers and more specialized subdivisions can be thought of to enable quicker and simpler governance. With these two chambers in mind we can now go into detail as to how each of these could be organized.
### Token Chamber
The role of the token chamber is to guide and approve the decisions taken by the contributor chamber especially when it concerns budgetary decisions. We understand that in most cases while contributors and token holders can have conflicting votes it is also true that the latter are providing treasury resources and as such can, and should, have a say into how they are distributed. Quadratic voting or other similar strategies used to reduce ‚Äúwhales‚Äù power could be adopted even in this scenario if preferred. Delegation should be encouraged to prevent large portions of the votes to be idle. 
## Contributor Chamber
The contributor chamber should have a more hand-on approach to governance, deciding on the day to day operations as well as the technical decisions if building a protocol or application. They are the ones who are working regularly on things and as such should have a bigger say on it. 
A more granular separation into working groups could be adopted to prevent decision fatigue and help decision making be more direct for day to day matters.
Contributors should also propose and vote periodically while consulting with the Token Chamber on higher level topics such as the mission and vision of the DAO, the roadmap as well as quarterly balances. 
### How would it work?
As proposed DAOs that adopt this scheme should create two separate governance spaces. One for the contributors and another for the tokenholders. While there would be some overlap between the two such as proposal content and authors, the voting status and the phase the proposal is on are separate for each of the forums. The process to approve an important could be as follows:
The Contributor Chamber votes and approves an important proposal, for example the DAO‚Äôs roadmap for 2023. 
The approved roadmap is submitted to the Token Chamber which votes on it and can send it back with modifications, suggestions back to the Contributor Chamber
Taking into account the previous step the Contributor Chamber votes again on the document after potentially making amends and takes a final decision. 
Other proposals on less crucial topics, could be subjected to this process:
The Contributor Chamber receives the proposal and subjects it to a signaling vote. 
During this signaling Token Chamber Members are invited to comment on the proposal topic as well
The Contributor Chamber votes on the proposal and executes it if passed. 
As the tokenholder chamber has a non-binding say on the proposals it is up to each DAO which proposals are subjected to a vote by both chambers. The logic behind a non-binding vote is described below. 
## The Power of the Blockchain
While there are many countries in which the decisions taken by both chambers are binding we propose an approach more similar to that taken currently in the UK. Here the House of the Lords (in our case the Token Chamber) has no ‚Äúfinal say‚Äù as in that they cannot veto (they can possibly delay) a proposal. 
While we see that in many countries there is a need to balance the power of two groups, the Internet in general and the blockchain in particular affords a very important possibility. ‚ÄúRage quit‚Äù, this enables tokenholders to withdraw support from the DAO and take their funds with them. It is difficult, if not impossible sometimes, to rage quit from living somewhere but in the context of the blockchain it can be as easy as a few signatures. 
As such while contributors are not forced to implement tokenholders suggestions, the possibility of the DAO having less funding will prove a good incentive while also allowing them to take command of the DAO. This should not work as a tool based on fear but rather as a way to give contributors the possibility to do what they feel is right for the DAO while also making token holders voices heard and their interests taken care of. 

## Background Information
Before diving into the proposal building we were going to need more information on the dynamics between whales and active users as well as used methods to mitigate the problem. While it is clear that the disparity between the token holdings of both actors are already a cause of concern on token voting systems, there is a case to be made for the existence of several other causes of concern. 
As proposed by Vitalik Buterin in his article ‚ÄúOn Collusion‚Äù, one big threat to such systems is embodied by wealthy individuals who might attempt to bribe either directly, or indirectly, token holders and contributors to vote according to their own agenda. Moreover, the article proposes the risk of taking out collateralized loans of the token used to grant voting rights so as to acquire these tokens and vote using them while not actually having any price exposure to it. 
Quadratic voting as introduced by Steven Lalley and Eric Glen has proved a commonly used strategy for DAO voting, as it reduces the voting power difference between token holders. 
Vote delegation can also prove powerful, as it enables smaller participants to pool their votes and select one or more representatives as well as change them at will in most cases if one were to become dissatisfied with their representation. 
While these strategies try to address the overwhelming power of whales they fail to address the role of active users and their importance in DAO decisions and day to day activities. The question is now how to enable coexistence of two different groups of interests within a DAO. How to balance the power of ‚Äúwhales‚Äù with those of the contributors whose work (sometimes even unpaid) makes the DAO exist and thrive. While it is clear that without them these organizations‚Äô tokens or NFTs would not have any value it is also true that differences between these two groups often arise. 
We analyzed the world and human history to try to find a solution for this problem in which two groups, often with colliding interests, have to not only coexist but also work together. 
One clear example of this is bicameral legislatures. This model was adopted by several governments throughout the world such as the US with the House of Representatives and the Senate and many other countries, especially in Europe and Latin America. In bicameral legislatures both houses 
This system of check and balances within the legislature body allows to reconcile opposing interests, in the example of the US the interests of more populous states with those more sparsely inhabited. While the fairness of the situation is a hotly debated topic it is an interesting paradigm to consider when applied to DAOs.
